# Docker image with Node.js and Python

Sometimes you want to customize your own base image. This article tells you how to build a image including `Python3.8`, `Node.js 14.x` based on a `Ubuntu 20.04` official base image.

1. create a `web.dockerfile`

    ```
    # Use Ubuntu 20.04 as the base image we build on.
    FROM ubuntu:20.04

    # Use `/app` as the directory we work in. This is not a special path though,
    # you just don't want everything created in the root ('/') directory.
    WORKDIR /app

    # You want to update `apt` first to install the latest packages with it.
    RUN apt update

    # Without doing the `curl` tasks before, you can only install Node.js v10.19.0 with `apt`.
    # https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#installation-instructions
    RUN \
        apt install -y curl && \
        curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash - && \
        apt install -y nodejs

    # Install Python3 and set the alias things like:
    #   1. `python` => `/usr/bin/python3.8` 
    #   2. `pip` => `/usr/bin/pip3`.
    # This will just make the life easiser.
    RUN \
        apt install -y python3.8 && \
        apt install -y python3-pip && \
        update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3.8 1 && \
        update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/pip pip /usr/bin/pip3 1

    # Install all the packages, with package management files.
    COPY requirements.txt package.json package-lock.json ./
    RUN \
        pip install -r requirements.txt && \
        npm ci

    # Finally, Copy all the other files.
    COPY . ./
    ```

    This give you a Python + Node.js base container

2. You can use it like this, create a docker-compose-yml

    ```
    version: "3.9"
    services:
      db:
        image: postgres
        volumes:
          - ./data/db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
        environment:
          - POSTGRES_DB=postgres
          - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
          - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
      web:
        build:
          context: .
          dockerfile: ./web.dockerfile
        environment:
          - HOST=0.0.0.0
        command: bash -c "npm start"
        volumes:
          - .:/app
        ports:
          - "8000:8000"
          - "3000:3000"
        depends_on:
          - db
    ```

    Now run `docker-compose up`, and everything should work as expected.
